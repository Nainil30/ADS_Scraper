## Overview
The **GitHub Topic Explorer** is a powerful tool designed to scrape detailed information about repositories from GitHub's topics section. It enables users to generate comprehensive datasets of repositories for academic and professional analysis, focusing on trending topics.

## Features
- **Automated Scraping:** Extract user names, repository names, stars, and more from GitHub topics.
- **Advanced Pagination:** Navigate through multiple pages to capture all available data.
- **Data Storage:** Outputs data into a CSV file, making it easy for further analysis.
- **Dynamic Content Handling:** Uses headless browsers to manage dynamically loaded content.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.11.2**: For scripting the scraper logic.
- **Requests**: To make HTTP requests to GitHub's API.
- **Selenium WebDriver**: For automating web browser interaction.
- **Beautiful Soup**: To parse HTML and XML documents.
- **Pandas**: To handle data manipulation and analysis.

## Challenges & Improvements
### Challenges
- **Dynamic Content:** The need for handling JavaScript-rendered content which is not readily accessible via traditional scraping methods.
- **API Rate Limits:** Encountering GitHub's rate limiting on API requests which can hinder continuous data scraping.

### Proposed Improvements
- **Enhanced Dynamic Handling:** Implement more robust methods using Chromium-based headless browsers for better rendering of dynamic content.
- **Rate Limit Optimization:** Develop a more efficient rate limiting strategy to maximize data retrieval without violating GitHub's API usage terms.
